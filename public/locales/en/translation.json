    "myself":"My name is Ilhom Saidov. I'm frontend software engineer. I have been working with computers since childhood. During my school years, I took part in city, regional, republican and international Olympiads in the field of information technology, where I took first, second and third places. At that time, in 2012-2015, we were working with the Qbasic programming language. My diploma and medals are still at home. Then I tried to learn how to program myself, but at first it was difficult for me! Therefore, I entered the programming academy, where there are many experienced teachers.There I studied the frontend for 10 months. I learned how to write code correctly, research, learn programming languages ​​and other subtleties of programming. Then we worked there. Together with the backend, we prepared several projects. I am currently working as a front-end developer at it-company REBUS.",
